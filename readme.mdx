# SDF Workspace Evaluator

This package contains various tests and reports that can be integrated into any SDF Workspace. It is designed to 
follow best practices in Data Engineering and provide a simple reusable framework that is equivalent across organizations and 
team sizes.

There are two components of this package:
 - **Workspace Checks** - which can be evaluated at compile time to provide guarantees during development.
 - **Workspace Reports** - which can be evaluated at compile time to provide high-level metrics about your workspace.

All of the Checks and Reports in this package depend purely on the tables found in `sdf.information_schema.*` tables.
SDF's information schema contains all metadata about the workspace, including DAG relationships, descriptions, and classifiers.
Check here for more information about (SDF's information schema)[https://docs.sdf.com/reference/sdf-information-schema].
