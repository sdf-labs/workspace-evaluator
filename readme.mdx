# SDF Workspace Evaluator

This package contains various tests and reports that can be integrated into any SDF Workspace. It is designed to 
follow best practices in Data Engineering and provide a simple reusable framework that is equivalent across organizations and 
team sizes.

There are two components of this package:
 - **Workspace Checks** - which can be evaluated at compile time to provide guarantees during development.
 - **Workspace Reports** - which can be evaluated at compile time to provide high-level metrics about your workspace.

All of the Checks and Reports in this package depend purely on the tables found in `sdf.information_schema.*` tables.
SDF's information schema contains all metadata about the workspace, including DAG relationships, descriptions, and classifiers.
Check here for more information about (SDF's information schema)[https://docs.sdf.com/reference/sdf-information-schema].

# Installing the Workspace Evaluator
To install the workspace evaluator in your project, add the *workspace-evaluator* dependency to your workspace.

``` yaml
workspace:
  ...
  dependencies:
    - name: workspace_evaluator
      git: https://github.com/sdf-labs/workspace-evaluator/workspace-evaluator.git
```

You may specify the git `tag` or `branch`.

## Usage
Once the reference to the workspace library has been added, simply invoke SDF to run reports.
``` shell
sdf report --show all
```

## Output.
You may run each report individually, or change output format via
``` shell
sdf report sdf.std_report.<REPORT_NAME> --format <FORMAT>
```

## Saving reports
SDF prints reports to the standard out. You may save one or more reports piping the standard out shell to a file.

``` shell
sdf report sdf.std_report.<REPORT_NAME> --show result --format nd-json > report.json
```
